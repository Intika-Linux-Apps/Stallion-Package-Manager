Stallion
=========

Stallion is a Python Package Manager interface created to provide an "easy-to-use" visual interface
for Python newcomers. Today we have many nice distribution utilities like pip, distribute, etc, but
we don't have a nice visual approach with these same goals. 

See screenshots at http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/wordpress/?p=2200
